An ethereal, slightly spontaneous introduction to Tae'lur

In my first blog post, I'll go over a bit about my background and interests

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).


Hey everyone! My name is Tae'lur Alexis. I am a Front-End Engineer as well as Founder of codeeveryday.io.

<div>I am passionate about building accessible UI and my interests range from writing to bellydancing. I started a Twitch channel dedicated to livestreaming while studying a variety of JavaScript libraries and frameworks. I look forward to diving deep into GatsbyJS, React Native, Redux, NextJS, and building progressive web apps and chatbots.</div>

<div>I am also in the process of building my side project turned startup, codeeveryday.io. The startup is a platform dedicated to providing learning resources, curating a study plan based on needs and goals, and a way to find mentorship and get connected with startups.</div>
